        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>
          The use cases for EventSphere would be primarily categorized relevant
          to three interactive entities which are namely the organizer, the
          attendee and the vendor as described below.
        </p>
        <!-- Updated section heading -->

        <!-- Event Organizer Use Cases -->
        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">1. Organizer Use Cases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The organizer can create the event by specifying event details such
            as date, time, location, ticket types, prices, and capacity. In
            order to do this, the organizer should be logged in to an
            “organizer” profile role. Once the event is created, the event
            details are saved in the system, making it available to attendees.
          </li>
          <li>
            The organizer can monitor and manage ticket sales in real time and
            view details like ticket types sold and the remaining capacity. This
            should only happen once the event is created. The sales and
            inventory updates are displayed to the organizer on the frontend.
          </li>
          <li>
            The organizer can add merchandise and concessions, allowing
            attendees to pre-order or purchase them at the event. This
            merchandise should be listed by the vendor to allow purchase.
          </li>
          <li>
            The organizer can access real-time analytics on ticket sales,
            attendee check-ins, merchandise sales, and vendor performance on an
            analytics dashboard.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Attendee Use Cases -->
        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">2. Attendee Use Cases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The attendee can search for and browse events based on categories,
            dates, locations, and popularity provided the event has been listed
            by the organizer. Any unlisted or in-progress events should not be
            visible to an attendee.
          </li>
          <li>
            The attendee can buy tickets for an event and receive a unique QR
            code. The attendee should only be able to purchase the ticket if a
            valid payment method is followed through and accepted. Once the
            payment is accepted, the QR code should be generated.
          </li>
          <li>
            The attendee can order food, drinks, and merchandise in advance,
            linked to their QR code for easy access at the event. Once the
            orders are accepted, the QR code should be regenerated or updated
            and the order should be saved.
          </li>
          <li>
            The attendee can check in to the event by scanning their QR code,
            which registers them as present and gives vendors access to their
            pre-ordered items once the vendor scans the QR code. The attendee
            can also purchase additional items at the vendor where the orders
            are processed and the QR code is updated accordingly.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Vendor Use Cases -->
        <h3 style="margin-top: 2rem">3. Vendor Use Cases</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Vendors can access a list of orders associated with attendee QR
            codes, fulfill these orders upon scan, and update order statuses.
            The attendee has to pre-order or make an in-event purchase for the
            same.
          </li>
          <li>
            Vendors can update inventory (e.g., stock levels for food, drink,
            merchandise) to provide real-time availability status. Organizers
            and attendees should be able to view the inventory status as well.
          </li>
        </ul>
