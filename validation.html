        <h1>Validation Testing</h1>
        <p style="padding: 15px;">This phase of testing involves validating the Health and Fitness Tracking application against the functional and non-functional requirements elicited in the design. The tests listed below 
            consider the application as a whole in terms of functionality, while also modulating test cases based on the different services in place to facilitate the modules. 
            Most of the requirements presented in the design, are testable, with the exception of a few which would need further clarity, based on the target user interface design and market feedback. 
            The requirements surrounding NFR-4, NFR-9, and NFR-5, were not directly testable.
