        <h2>Functional Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          The test scope encompasses integration and validation testing of key functionalities to ensure seamless operation across all components. User authentication and profile management features will be tested to verify secure registration, login, and profile management with accurate data storage and retrieval. The workout logging functionality will be validated for accurate tracking of exercise type, duration, intensity, and other metrics, ensuring this data is saved and displayed correctly. The nutrition tracking system will be evaluated for the ability to log meals, calories, and macronutrients accurately, with proper calculations and storage. Progress tracking and insights features will be tested to ensure accurate generation of reports and visual progress displays based on user data. Social features, such as sharing achievements, commenting, and liking posts, will be validated for correct functionality. Tests will confirm that users can set and track personalized goals. Finally, the integration of third-party fitness APIs and wearable devices will be verified to ensure proper data synchronization and operation.

        <h2>Performance Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          Performance testing will validate the system’s capacity to handle over 1,000 concurrent users without performance degradation. Response times will be evaluated to confirm that processes like workout logging and report generation complete within two seconds. The system’s scalability will also be assessed to ensure horizontal scalability and adaptability to increased user demand, particularly in high-load modules such as the Analytics Engine and Workout Tracker.
        </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Internal Design Characteristics</h2>
        <p>
          The internal design tests will focus on the integrity and efficiency of communication between microservices, including User Management, Workout Tracker, and Nutrition Log, to ensure smooth data flow. Data security and privacy will be validated by testing encryption protocols for data at rest and in transit, ensuring compliance with standards such as GDPR. System reliability will be tested through uptime validation and fault tolerance assessments, ensuring continued operation despite localized failures. Finally, the modular architecture will be evaluated for scalability and maintainability, confirming that updates or enhancements to one module, such as the Analytics Engine, do not disrupt other system components.
