            <h2> Approach </h2>
        <p> For this project, we recommend conducting the integration testing in three separate phases using a Bottom-Up approach. </p>
       </div>
        <div class="section">
                <h2> Phase 1: Backend and Microservices </h2>
        <p> The first phase will focus on integrating the backend and microservices that form the core of the Health and Fitness 
            Tracking Application. This segment of the system includes the database stored on AWS RDS, the User Authentication and 
            Management Service, the Fitness Logging and Nutrition Tracking Service, the Analytics and Progress Computation Module, 
            and third-party API integrations for fetching external data to enhance the user experience. The components tested in this 
            phase will be the REST APIs provided by the backend services, ensuring they function as intended and securely handle user data.
             This foundational phase ensures that critical backend systems are reliable before adding middleware and frontend layers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
                <h2> Phase 2: Middleware and Load Balancers </h2>
        <p> The second phase will focus on integrating the middleware and load balancers, which connect the backend services to the frontend. 
            This phase will include all components from phase one, along with load balancers for traffic distribution and a notification service for 
            sending user alerts such as workout reminders and nutrition updates. The primary objective in this phase is to validate 
            the communication between the load balancers and backend services, ensuring balanced request distribution and failover capabilities under high load conditions. 
            Additionally, this phase will test the notification service for accurate and timely delivery of alerts, focusing on performance, scalability, and data synchronization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
                <h2> Phase 3: Frontend Integration </h2>
        <p> The third phase will concentrate on integrating the frontend user interface with the backend and middleware services. This phase
                will validate the end-to-end user experience by simulating user actions in a controlled test environment. The main objectives of 
                Phase 3 testing are to ensure that each UI action correctly invokes the appropriate backend service, receives timely and accurate 
                responses, displays analytics and progress reports correctly, handles error conditions gracefully, and maintains a responsive and 
                intuitive interface under typical and peak load conditions. By testing the frontend integration, we confirm that the application 
                functions as intended from the user's perspective.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
                <h2> Rationale </h2>
        <p> The Bottom-Up approach to integration testing allows us to validate the system incrementally, starting with the core backend
                components and gradually adding layers of complexity. This method ensures that each segment of the system is thoroughly tested 
                before moving on to the next phase, reducing the risk of overlooking critical issues. By following this structured approach, we 
                can identify and address integration problems early in the development process, leading to a more stable and reliable application.</p>
