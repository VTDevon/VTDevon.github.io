            <h2> Approach </h2>
        <p> For this project, we recommend conducting the integration testing in three separate phases using a Bottom-Up approach. </p>
       </div>
        <div class="section">
                <h2> Phase 1: Backend and Microservices </h2>
        <p> The first phase will focus on integrating the backend and microservices that form the core of the Health and Fitness 
            Tracking Application. This segment of the system includes the database stored on AWS RDS, the User Authentication and 
            Management Service, the Fitness Logging and Nutrition Tracking Service, the Analytics and Progress Computation Module, 
            and third-party API integrations for fetching external data to enhance the user experience. The components tested in this 
            phase will be the REST APIs provided by the backend services, ensuring they function as intended and securely handle user data.
             This foundational phase ensures that critical backend systems are reliable before adding middleware and frontend layers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
                <h2> Phase 2: Middleware and Load Balancers </h2>
        <p> The second phase will focus on integrating the middleware and load balancers, which connect the backend services to the frontend. 
            This phase will include all components from phase one, along with load balancers for traffic distribution and a notification service for 
            sending user alerts such as workout reminders and nutrition updates. The primary objective in this phase is to validate 
            the communication between the load balancers and backend services, ensuring balanced request distribution and failover capabilities under high load conditions. 
            Additionally, this phase will test the notification service for accurate and timely delivery of alerts, focusing on performance, scalability, and data synchronization.</p>

        <div class="section">
                <h2> Phase 3: Frontend Integration </h2>
        <p> The third phase will focus on integrating the frontend. This build will represent the entire application, including the user 
            interface for both web and mobile platforms, as well as controllers for user actions such as goal setting, workout logging, 
            community engagement, and analytics visualization. The integration of the frontend ensures that user interactions trigger the 
            appropriate backend processes through the API Gateway, and that the system provides real-time updates for dashboards, 
            notifications, and community activity feeds. This phase also tests error handling for invalid inputs, network issues, and 
            other edge cases to maintain a responsive and intuitive user experience.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
                <h2> Rationale </h2>
        <p> The Bottom-Up approach to integration testing allows us to validate the system incrementally, starting with the core backend 
            components and gradually adding layers of complexity. This method ensures that each segment of the system is thoroughly tested 
            before moving on to the next phase, reducing the risk of overlooking critical issues. By following this structured approach, 
            we can identify and address integration problems early in the development process, leading to a more stable and reliable 
            application. Additionally, starting with the backend ensures that the system's foundation is stable and dependable before 
            integrating other layers. This is particularly crucial for an API-driven application like the Health and Fitness Tracking 
            Application, where the backend serves as the backbone for all user interactions and data processing.</p>
