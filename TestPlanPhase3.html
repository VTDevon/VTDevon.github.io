<h1>Phase 3: Frontend Integration Test Procedures</h1>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    In Phase 3, we integrate the frontend (both web and mobile interfaces) with the backend services and middleware 
    tested in the previous phases. At this stage, all major backend components, load balancers, and notification services 
    are assumed to be stable. Our primary focus now shifts to ensuring that the user interface correctly interacts with the 
    underlying infrastructure. We will verify that user actions at the UI level trigger the intended backend processes, 
    produce accurate analytics, and display relevant community interactions without performance degradation or security 
    issues.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Components Included</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Frontend User Interface (Web and Mobile):</strong> The complete user interface layer, 
        including login screens, workout logging forms, nutrition input pages, goal-setting wizards, 
        community activity feeds, and progress dashboards.</li>
    <li><strong>Backend and Middleware Services (From Phases 1 & 2):</strong> All previously validated 
        backend microservices, database operations, load balancers, and notification triggers are now integrated 
        with the UI.</li>
    <li><strong>API Gateway and Routing:</strong> The final routing layer that ensures requests from the UI 
        reach the correct backend services.</li>
    <li><strong>Controller Modules for UI Actions:</strong> 
      <ul>
        <li>Goal Setting and Tracking Controller</li>
        <li>Workout Logging Controller</li>
        <li>Community Engagement Controller (forum, activity feed, social posts)</li>
        <li>Progress Dashboard Controller (analytics visualizations)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

  <h2>Main Purpose of Phase 3 Testing</h2>
  <p>
    The main purpose of the Phase 3 tests is to validate the end-to-end user experience. By simulating user actions in a 
    controlled test environment, we ensure that each UI action:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Correctly invokes the appropriate backend service via the API Gateway.</li>
    <li>Receives timely and accurate responses (e.g., updated workout data, nutritional insights, community posts).</li>
    <li>Displays analytics and progress reports correctly, reflecting real backend computations.</li>
    <li>Handles error conditions gracefully (e.g., network timeouts, invalid input, or server errors) with 
        user-friendly messages.</li>
    <li>Maintains a responsive and intuitive interface under typical and peak load conditions.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Test Environment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Staging Server:</strong> A staging environment mirroring the production infrastructure will be used, 
        complete with all backend services, load balancers, and databases populated with representative (but anonymized) 
        test data.</li>
    <li><strong>Test Devices:</strong> Various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) and mobile platforms (Android, iOS) to 
        ensure cross-platform compatibility and responsive design.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Simulation Tools:</strong> For simulating slow connections or packet loss, to test UI resilience.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Test Procedure and Case Skeletons</h2>
  <p>The following are high-level test case skeletons; they define the sequence of user actions and expected interactions 
     without specifying exact data values or outcomes. Detailed test data will be refined later.</p>

  <h3>User Login and Profile Setup</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-01:</strong> User opens the application and logs in with valid credentials. 
        Verify correct retrieval of user profile, fitness goals, and initial dashboard metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-02:</strong> User attempts to log in with invalid credentials. Confirm that error messages are 
        displayed without crashing the UI.</li>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-03:</strong> User updates profile preferences (e.g., changing a dietary goal) and saves. Check if 
        the changes propagate through the backend and refresh the dashboard view accordingly.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Workout Logging and Nutrition Tracking</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-04:</strong> User navigates to the workout log screen, enters a new workout session (e.g., exercises, duration), 
        and submits. Confirm that the UI updates to reflect the new workout entry and that backend data is retrieved and displayed 
        in the progress charts.</li>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-05:</strong> User inputs daily nutrition data (meals, calories) and saves entries. Verify that nutritional 
        insights appear on the dashboard and that the API gateway handles these updates promptly.</li>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-06:</strong> User attempts to log invalid nutrition data (e.g., negative calorie values). Check that the UI 
        gracefully handles errors with user-friendly validation messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Community and Social Features</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-07:</strong> User views the community activity feed, likes a post, and comments on a friend’s achievement. 
        Validate that these actions reflect on the UI in near real-time and that backend confirms the successful update.</li>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-08:</strong> User tries to access a community feature without proper authentication (e.g., bookmarked link 
        without logging in). The UI should redirect to the login page with an explanatory message.</li>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-09:</strong> User joins a challenge or group event and sees updates instantly within their dashboard, 
        confirming that event participation data is retrieved correctly from the backend.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Progress Dashboard and Analytics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-10:</strong> User navigates to the progress dashboard and selects different time ranges (e.g., weekly, monthly). 
        Confirm charts and graphs update with correct data received from the analytics service.</li>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-11:</strong> User performs multiple rapid interactions (e.g., switching between workout history and nutrition 
        trends) to test the UI’s responsiveness and confirm that load balancers and backend services handle requests efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>TC-FE-12:</strong> User views progress analytics offline or under network latency conditions. The UI should notify 
        the user of connectivity issues and prevent data corruption or inaccurate displays.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Overhead Software (Drivers, Stubs, and Test Tools)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>UI Test Automation Drivers:</strong> Tools like Selenium WebDriver or Cypress for web UI testing, and Appium for 
        mobile testing. These drivers will execute scripted user actions, ensuring consistent and repeatable test runs.</li>
    <li><strong>Mock Services and Local Test Servers:</strong> While Phase 3 primarily relies on the now-integrated backend, 
        certain edge cases (e.g., simulating a failed analytics computation) may still use mock endpoints or local test servers 
        to verify UI behavior in exceptional scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Network Condition Simulators:</strong> Tools to throttle bandwidth or inject artificial latency ensure UI remains 
        functional and provides useful feedback under non-ideal network conditions.</li>
    <li><strong>No Additional Stubs Needed for Core Backend:</strong> Since Phases 1 and 2 have already validated backend and 
        middleware, minimal stubs are required. The focus is on full end-to-end functionality rather than isolated component tests.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h2>Rationale for Phase 3 Strategy</h2>
  <p>
    By completing the backend integration and middleware verification in earlier phases, Phase 3 can focus squarely on the user 
    experience and the correctness of front-to-back communication. With stable backend services in place, testers can now replicate 
    real user journeys, verifying that every tap, click, and input leads to accurate and timely results on the frontend. This 
    reduces reliance on artificial stubs, ensuring that discovered defects reflect genuine integration or user interaction issues, 
    rather than mock environment limitations.
