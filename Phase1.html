      <h1>Phase 1: Backend and Microservices Test Procedures</h1>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Phase 1 focuses on testing the core backend systems and microservices that form the foundation of the Health and Fitness 
          Tracking Application. The goal is to ensure the backend services function as intended and can handle user data securely and 
          efficiently. By validating the functionality and integration of microservices, database interactions, and third-party APIs 
          in this phase, we lay the groundwork for reliable middleware and frontend integration in later phases.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Components Included</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>User Authentication and Management Service:</strong> Handles user login, registration, and profile management, 
              ensuring secure access and data integrity.</li>
          <li><strong>Fitness Logging and Nutrition Tracking Service:</strong> Allows users to log workouts and nutrition data, storing 
              this information in the database for later analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>Database (AWS RDS):</strong> Stores user profiles, fitness logs, nutrition entries, and other application data.</li>
          <li><strong>Third-Party API Integration:</strong> Fetches nutrition and workout data from external APIs to enrich the user experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Analytics and Progress Computation Module:</strong> Computes fitness metrics, aggregates user data, and generates 
              progress reports and insights.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Main Purpose of Phase 1 Testing</h2>
        <p>
          The main objective of Phase 1 is to validate that each backend component operates independently and interacts correctly with 
          other components. The focus includes verifying REST API functionality, database schema and operations, integration with 
          third-party APIs, and the accuracy of analytics calculations. This ensures a robust backend before introducing additional 
          layers such as middleware and frontend interfaces.

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Test Environment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Backend Deployment:</strong> Hosted on a staging environment replicating the production setup, including AWS RDS 
              for database storage and mock services for third-party APIs.</li>
          <li><strong>API Testing Tools:</strong> Postman or similar tools for testing REST API endpoints.</li>
          <li><strong>Database Management Tools:</strong> Tools like MySQL Workbench for validating database schema and CRUD operations.</li>
          <li><strong>Mock API Services:</strong> Simulates responses from third-party APIs to test integrations without external dependencies.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Test Procedure and Case Skeletons</h2>
        <p>Below is a list of test case skeletons designed to validate the functionality of individual backend components and their interactions. 
          Specific test data and expected results will be refined in later stages.</p>
        <h3>User Authentication and Management Service</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>TC-BE-01:</strong> Test user registration with valid data. Verify the user is stored in the database, and credentials are securely hashed.</li>
          <li><strong>TC-BE-02:</strong> Test user login with valid and invalid credentials. Ensure valid credentials return a session token, and invalid credentials result in appropriate error messages.</li>
          <li><strong>TC-BE-03:</strong> Test profile updates (e.g., changing goals). Verify updates are reflected in the database and are accessible through API calls.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Fitness Logging and Nutrition Tracking Service</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>TC-BE-04:</strong> Test logging a workout (exercise type, duration, intensity). Verify the data is stored correctly and retrieved for progress analysis.</li>
          <li><strong>TC-BE-05:</strong> Test logging nutrition data (meals, calories, macronutrients). Confirm that entries are saved and linked to the correct user profile.</li>
          <li><strong>TC-BE-06:</strong> Test invalid input for workouts or nutrition (e.g., negative calorie values). Ensure the system rejects invalid data and provides meaningful error messages.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Database Operations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>TC-BE-07:</strong> Verify the database schema against requirements. Confirm all tables and fields align with the expected design.</li>
          <li><strong>TC-BE-08:</strong> Test CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user profiles, workouts, and nutrition entries. Ensure all operations maintain data integrity.</li>
          <li><strong>TC-BE-09:</strong> Test data retrieval for progress analysis (e.g., fetching workouts for a specific date range). Validate performance and accuracy of results.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Overhead Software (Drivers, Stubs, and Test Tools)</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>API Test Automation:</strong> Use tools like Postman or JMeter to automate testing of REST API endpoints.</li>
          <li><strong>Mock API Services:</strong> Simulate third-party APIs to test system responses under controlled conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>Database Testing Frameworks:</strong> Use tools like Flyway for schema validation and data integrity tests.</li>
          <li><strong>Error Simulation Drivers:</strong> Inject artificial errors (e.g., API timeouts, database connection failures) to test system resilience.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance Testing Tools:</strong> Use tools like Apache JMeter to test scalability and response times under simulated load.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Rationale for Phase 1 Strategy</h2>
        <p>
          Focusing on the backend and microservices in Phase 1 ensures the foundation of the system is reliable before introducing 
          middleware and frontend layers. By validating core services, database operations, and external API integrations early, 
          we can address potential issues at their source, reducing the risk of cascading failures during later integration phases. 
          This approach also minimizes reliance on stubs for backend functionality in subsequent phases, enabling more realistic 
          end-to-end testing.
